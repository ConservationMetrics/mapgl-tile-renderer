# Using Git

We use GitHub to host code, track issues, and accept pull requests.

## Git Branching

**We build and release from the `main` branch, so code merged here should always be stable.**

Prefer short-lived feature branches.
- Piecemeal progress towards broad code changes should merge to long-running branches until
  everything there is stable and deployable, at which point the long-running branch gets merged
  to `main`.
- Since short, coherent patches are easier to review, we code-review the individual PRs into
  the long-running feature branch (instead of review when merging the long-running branch to
  `main`)

## Committing code

Multiple commits or PRs can be created for an Issue. e.g. each implementation step might get its own PR.

Code review is not required, but is encouraged as a powerful tool for learning.  Benefits include:
- Spread knowledge of the code base throughout the team.
- Expose everyone to different approaches.
- Ensure code is readable (and therefore maintainable).
- Yield better software (but ultimately the responsibility
  for bug-free code is on the code author, not the reviewer).

Code review is not limited to approval/rejection of PRs. Also consider involving a collaborator
earlier in the process, before the code is finished.  Ask them for a narrower reviewâ€”e.g., a
design review or to focus on a specific part of the code change.

Merging branches and PRs to `main`:
- Code should be merged by the branch author, unless a merge is urgently needed.
- Merge PRs via 'Squash and Merge' option in GitHub.
- Delete a branch when you are done with it.
