# Since this project demonstrates a generic deployment for the open-source community,
# ignore actual deployments:
*.tfvars

# Secrets tfvars
**/secret.auto.tfvars

# Local .terraform directories
**/.terraform/*

# .tfstate files
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.*

# Lock files for Terraform directories that CircleCI manages
# (CircleCI is often the only thing that generates these and there's no good way
# to have it commit them back to version control.)
.terraform.lock.hcl

# Crash log files
crash.log

# Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally and so
# are not checked in
override.tf
override.tf.json
*_override.tf
*_override.tf.json

# Include override files you do wish to add to version control using negated pattern
#
# !example_override.tf

# Include tfplan files to ignore the plan output of command: terraform plan -out=tfplan
# example: *tfplan*
